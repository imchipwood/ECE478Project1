# ECE478Project1

This repo is the home for the ECE 4/578 robotics project 1.

## Project Assienment

Happy Robot

## Task

Program / edit/ animate as described in script for Happy Robot Play
by Wojtyszko. Do not change text, follow suggested behaviors.

## Team Members

- Charles Wood <chawood@pdx.edu>
- John Andersen <jsa3@pdx.edu>
- Matty Baba Allos <matty@pdx.edu>

## Detailed Requirements

1. Learn documentation of HR-OS1 robot in full detail. Read
  previous students reports. Understand the principles of
  designing robot motions, understand the formats of data and their
  transformation. Learn basic kinematics/dynamics of your robot.
2. You can use any method of animation or any mixture of methods.
3. Animate all behaviors as in the original scripts assigned to
  each team. Do not change them. If you are interested to change
  them, you can do this next quarter.
4. Use your knowledge of animation from movies and from puppet
  theatre.
5. Try to create realistic and smooth motions. Take into account
  personality of each robot.
6. Take into account what did you learn from movies that I showed
  in class.
7. Robots must always, in every moment of time, execute some
  motion. The humans always are in move, they are never like
  monuments or mannequins. Do not assume that when the robot talks it
  is not moving. Gestures of the robot should illustrate the text
  that he actually talks.
8. If you have troubles with balancing and stability of behavior,
  do not worry too much. Next projects will use feedbacks in
  various forms to improve. It is more important that you will
  animate/program all necessary behaviors, motions and texts than
  having everything stable and perfect. This is just a second stage
  of prototyping robot theatre of this type ever.
9. Write your ideas and observations in final report.
10. Document all work stages and final result in a video. Use any
  video editor to complete the video.
11. In your report document all troubles with robot animation and
  especially lack of balance, falling down, and troubles with
  precise walks and rotations.
